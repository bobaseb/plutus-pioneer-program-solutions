# Week 06 Homework (Plutus Pioneer Program)

This week had a long lecture presenting how to build a full oracle with executables and swap contracts (e.g., swapping USDT & ADA) that could interact with it. This included presentation of the Plutus Application Backend (PAB) as well. The homework for this week was simply to get the executable demos to work on your system and perhaps play around with the code a bit.
