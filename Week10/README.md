# Week 10 Homework (Plutus Pioneer Program)

No homework for this week. Lars ran us through a Uniswap demo he wrote up. He also showed us how to interact with the Plutus Application Backend (PAB) and use curl requests. He challenged us to optionally create our own Javascript frontend or write up the Uniswap demo using state machines (if possible).
