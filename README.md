#Plutus Pioneer Program (PPP) Solutions

The Plutus Pioneer Program (PPP) can be accessed [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program).

This repository just has my solutions for each week's homework. I was part of the second cohort (Summer 2021).

PPP was a training program for onboarding developers into the Plutus scripting language for [Cardano](cardano.org) (written in Haskell).
