#Week 07 Homework (Plutus Pioneer Program)

This week had a long lecture presenting how to build a state machine to handle a simplified version of Rock, Paper, Scissors but with only two moves (Zero & One). The homework for this week was to modify the state machine to implement the standard version of Rock, Paper, Scissors with stake given back to players if tied. 

I managed to do the homework but had some remaining questions:

1) I was left with some uncertainty as to whether the NFT goes back to the first player or not if tied. The state machine should handle that (I believe) for all cases when the machine terminates. 

2) I was also not sure how to check if the game was lost or tied for player 2 since the state machine would have been terminated by then.
